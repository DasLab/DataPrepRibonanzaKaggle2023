## What's in here

* `matlab` - scripts that need to be added to your MATLAB path to run the scripts
* `example` - curated example data and script that allows a run-through of the scripts (see next section).
* `actual` - actual scripts used to prepare data sets. Note that this won't work without the full paths to the data, which are available in [DataAnalysis](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1i3PH2LIW5XEenZ0J-JiZx-1Bz46YYo2Y&usp=drive_fs) and will be publicly released after competition close.
